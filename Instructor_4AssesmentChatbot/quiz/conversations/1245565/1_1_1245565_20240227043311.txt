Question: What is the first step in the Six-Step Problem Solving Model?
Answer: Define
Evaluation: I would give this response a 7 out of 10. The answer is partially correct as it refers to the proper first step which is to define the problem. However, it lacks the completeness of the term 'Define the problem'. It would garner a perfect score if the 'the problem' part was included. Full points are awarded for complete and articulated answers.
