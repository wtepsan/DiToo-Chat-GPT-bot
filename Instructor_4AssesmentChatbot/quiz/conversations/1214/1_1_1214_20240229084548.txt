Question: What is the first step in the Six-Step Problem Solving Model?
Answer: Define
Evaluation: Marks: 7/10

Feedback: Good job on recognizing that the first step in the Six-Step Problem Solving Model is to "define", or identify, the issue that needs to be addressed. However, the answer lacks specificity. Adding the word "problem" to "define" would have made your answer more complete and accurate, as in "Define the problem". Be sure to provide complete answers to fully demonstrate your understanding.
